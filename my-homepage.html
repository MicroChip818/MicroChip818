        <p>Welcome to my homepage!  I'm Ethan, a 14-year-old boy who's interested in coding, basketball, swimming, gaming, money, etc!  You can find all my coding projects in this homepage!  I want to be a successful freelance coder and blogger one day!</p>
        <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
          <p>I have started coding when I was in kindergarten or 1st grade.  My teachers back then taught me and my classmates the basics of coding on a site called Code.org.  For those who don''t know what code.org is, this website contains many fun coding courses and lessons.  These lessons use both block coding (elementary school) and text coding (middle school and up).  I tried block coding on Code.org, and that was the moment I knew coding was for me.  Thank you Repetto School teachers!</p>
