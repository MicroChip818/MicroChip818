        <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
        <h3>I have used many coding platforms from the beginning of my coding journey in kindergarten or 1st grade.</h3>
          
        <ul>
          <li>Code.org</li>
          <h4>Recommended for: People who are interested in coding and new to coding</h4>
          <p>I have started coding when I was in kindergarten or 1st grade.  My teachers back then taught me and my classmates the basics of coding on a site called code.org.  For those who don''t know what code.org is, this website contains many fun coding courses and lessons.  These lessons use both block coding (elementary school) and text coding (middle school and up).  I tried block coding on Code.org, and that was the moment I knew coding was for me.</p>

          <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
          <h4>Recommended for: People with block coding experience who want to learn about text coding (the next level of coding)</h4>
          <p>During 3rd grade, I discovered a website to learn text coding called freecodecamp.org.  This is where I first learned text-based coding languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for the first time.  However, I got demotivated to keep working and quit until 6th grade.  I have taken many breaks and returned back to coding until now.  Hopefully, this habit will change.</p>

          <h4>Recommended for: People with block coding experience who want to show off their creativity by creating immersive projects</h4>
          <p>During my free time, I used to create many projects on Scratch.  I created a penguin jumping game and a few idle/clicker games (one of my favorite game genres) on Scratch.  I even created an About Me project on Scratch for a summer camp assignment!  You can check out some of my projects here:</p>
